# Unclosed HTML Element Tag Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: a missing closing tag.  Missing closing tags can lead to unpredictable layout and rendering issues in the browser.  The provided `bug.html` file contains the error, while `solution.html` shows the corrected version.

## Bug Description

A missing closing tag, such as `&lt;/div&gt;`, can cause the browser to incorrectly interpret the structure of the HTML document. This may manifest as unexpected layout shifts, missing content, or other visual anomalies.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the incorrect layout or rendering.
3. Open `solution.html` to see the corrected HTML.

## Solution

Ensure all HTML elements have correctly paired opening and closing tags.  Using a good code editor or IDE with syntax highlighting and validation can help prevent this type of error.
