<p>This is a common HTML error that many developers often overlook. It's caused by a missing closing tag for an element. The browser often tries its best to interpret the HTML, but this can lead to unexpected layout issues or other rendering problems, particularly when the missing tag is within nested elements. For example, a missing closing `</div>` tag can mess up the layout of subsequent elements.</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;
